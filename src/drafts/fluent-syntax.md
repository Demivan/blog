Software localization has been dominated by an outdated paradigm: the translation is just a dictionary of strings which map one-to-one to the English copy. This paradigm is unfair and limiting to languages with grammars more complex than English. For any grammatical feature not supported by English, a special case must be added to the source code, leaking logic into all translations. Furthermore, creating good UIs which depend on multiple external arguments is hard and requires the developer to understand the grammar of the languages the product targets.
